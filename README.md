## Motivation

Codeology's day 1 goal has always been to support underprivleged youth. The education and luxuries that we have can sometimes be taken for granted. This is why Codeology has always aimed to help increase the accessibility of education for children abroad. All proceeds from the platform are directly donated to an Indian chairty, Asha for Education.
